### ðŸ’¥ Breaking

* [#171](https://github.com/microsoft/terraform-provider-fabric/issues/171) The `format` attribute is now REQUIRED for Resources/Data-Sources with definition support.
Currently applicable to the following Resources/Data-Sources: Report, Notebook, Semantic Model, and Spark Job Definition.

* [#185](https://github.com/microsoft/terraform-provider-fabric/issues/185) Using preview resources or data sources now needs explicit opt-in at the provider level configuration by setting the `preview` attribute to `true`.

Usage of any preview feature will result in a warning message in the Terraform output.
