# fabric_graphql_api (Resource)

Manage a Fabric GraphQL API.

Use this resource to manage [GraphQL API](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-engineering/api-graphql-overview).

-> This item supports Service Principal authentication.

~> This resource is in **preview**. To access it, you must explicitly enable the `preview` mode in the provider level configuration.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Example 1 - basic item
resource "fabric_graphql_api" "example" {
  display_name = "example"
  workspace_id = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
}

# Example 2 - item with definition bootstrapping only
resource "fabric_graphql_api" "example_definition_bootstrap" {
  display_name              = "example"
  description               = "example with definition bootstrapping"
  workspace_id              = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
  format                    = "Default"
  definition_update_enabled = false
  definition = {
    "graphql-definition.json" = {
      source = "${local.path}/graphql-definition.json"
      tokens = {
        "MyKey" = "MyValue"
      }
    }
  }
}

# Example 3 - item with definition update when source or tokens changed
resource "fabric_graphql_api" "example_definition_update" {
  display_name = "example"
  description  = "example with definition update when source or tokens changed"
  workspace_id = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
  format       = "Default"
  definition = {
    "graphql-definition.json" = {
      source = "${local.path}/graphql-definition.json"
      tokens = {
        "MyKey" = "MyValue"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `display_name` (String) The GraphQL API display name.
- `workspace_id` (String) The Workspace ID.

### Optional

- `definition` (Attributes Map) Definition parts. Read more about [GraphQL API definition part paths](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/fabric/articles/item-management/definitions/graphql-api-definition). Accepted path keys: **Default** format: `graphql-definition.json` (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--definition))
- `definition_update_enabled` (Boolean) Update definition on change of source content. Default: `true`.
- `description` (String) The GraphQL API description.
- `format` (String) The GraphQL API format. Possible values: `Default`
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The GraphQL API ID.

<a id="nestedatt--definition"></a>

### Nested Schema for `definition`

Required:

- `source` (String) Path to the file with source of the definition part.

The source content may include placeholders for token substitution. Use the dot with the token name `{{ .TokenName }}`.

Optional:

- `tokens` (Map of String) A map of key/value pairs of tokens substitutes in the source.

Read-Only:

- `source_content_sha256` (String) SHA256 of source's content of definition part.

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# terraform import fabric_graphql_api.example "<WorkspaceID>/<GraphQLApiID>"
terraform import fabric_graphql_api.example "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111"
```
