# fabric_domain (Resource)

The Domain resource allows you to manage [Domain](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/governance/domains).

-> This resource supports Service Principal authentication.

~> This resource is in **preview**. To access it, you must explicitly enable the `preview` mode in the provider level configuration.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "fabric_domain" "parent" {
  display_name = "example parent"
}

resource "fabric_domain" "child" {
  display_name     = "example child"
  description      = "This is an example child domain"
  parent_domain_id = fabric_domain.parent.id
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `display_name` (String) The Domain display name. String length must be at most 40.

### Optional

- `contributors_scope` (String) The Domain contributors scope (Contributors scope can only be set at the root domain level!). Value must be one of : `AdminsOnly`, `AllTenant`, `SpecificUsersAndGroups`. Ensure that if an attribute is set, these are not set: "[parent_domain_id]".

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
