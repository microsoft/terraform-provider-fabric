# fabric_domain (Resource)

The Domain resource allows you to manage a Fabric [Domain](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/governance/domains).

-> This resource supports Service Principal authentication.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "fabric_domain" "parent" {
  display_name = "example parent"
}

resource "fabric_domain" "child" {
  display_name     = "example child"
  description      = "This is an example child domain"
  parent_domain_id = fabric_domain.parent.id
}

#domain update example
# resource "fabric_domain" "example_update" {
#   display_name     = "example child"
#   description      = "This is an example updated domain"
#   default_label_id = "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111"
# }
```

## Schema

### Required

- `display_name` (String) The Domain display name. String length must be at most 40.

### Optional

- `default_label_id` (String) The domain default sensitivity label. To remove the defaultLabelId from a domain, set its value to an empty UUID in your request: '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000'.
- `description` (String) The Domain description. Value defaults to ``. String length must be at most 256.
- `parent_domain_id` (String) <i style="color:red;font-weight: bold">(ForceNew)</i> The Domain parent ID.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The Domain ID.

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
# terraform import fabric_domain.example "<DomainID>"
terraform import fabric_domain.example "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
```
