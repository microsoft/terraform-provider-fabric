# fabric_report (Resource)

The Report resource allows you to manage a Fabric [Report](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/developer/projects/projects-report).

-> This resource supports Service Principal authentication.

~> **Important for PBIR Format**: When using `format = "PBIR"`, you must include at least one page file in your definition with a path matching `definition/pages/*.json`. This is required by the PBIR format specification. If you don't include pages, you'll get a validation error during planning.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Report bootstrapping only
resource "fabric_report" "example_bootstrap" {
  display_name              = "example"
  workspace_id              = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
  definition_update_enabled = false
  format                    = "PBIR-Legacy"
  definition = {
    "report.json" = {
      source = "${local.path}/report.json"
    }
    "definition.pbir" = {
      source = "${local.path}/definition.pbir.tmpl"
      tokens = {
        "SemanticModelID" = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
      }
    }
    "StaticResources/SharedResources/BaseThemes/CY24SU10.json" = {
      source = "${local.path}/StaticResources/SharedResources/BaseThemes/CY24SU10.json"
    }
    "StaticResources/RegisteredResources/fabric_48_color10148978481469717.png" = {
      source = "${local.path}/StaticResources/RegisteredResources/fabric_48_color10148978481469717.png"
    }
  }
}

# Report with update when source or tokens changed
resource "fabric_report" "example_update" {
  display_name = "example with update"
  workspace_id = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
  format       = "PBIR-Legacy"
  definition = {
    "report.json" = {
      source = "${local.path}/report.json"
    }
    "definition.pbir" = {
      source = "${local.path}/definition.pbir.tmpl"
      tokens = {
        "SemanticModelID" = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
      }
    }
    "StaticResources/SharedResources/BaseThemes/CY24SU10.json" = {
      source = "${local.path}/StaticResources/SharedResources/BaseThemes/CY24SU10.json"
    }
  }
}

# Report with PBIR format (requires pages)
resource "fabric_report" "example_pbir" {
  display_name = "example with PBIR format"
  workspace_id = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
  format       = "PBIR"
  definition = {
    "definition/report.json" = {
      source = "${local.path}/definition/report.json"
    }
    "definition/version.json" = {
      source = "${local.path}/definition/version.json"
    }
    "definition.pbir" = {
      source = "${local.path}/definition.pbir.tmpl"
      tokens = {
        "SemanticModelID" = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
      }
    }
    "definition/pages/page1.json" = {
      source = "${local.path}/definition/pages/page1.json"
    }
    "StaticResources/SharedResources/BaseThemes/CY24SU10.json" = {
      source = "${local.path}/StaticResources/SharedResources/BaseThemes/CY24SU10.json"
    }
  }
}

## Schema

### Required

- `definition` (Attributes Map) Definition parts. Read more about [Report definition part paths](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/fabric/articles/item-management/definitions/report-definition). Accepted path keys: **PBIR** format: `StaticResources/RegisteredResources/*`, `StaticResources/SharedResources/*`, `definition.pbir`, `definition/bookmarks/*.json`, `definition/pages/*.json`, `definition/report.json`, `definition/version.json` **PBIR-Legacy** format: `StaticResources/RegisteredResources/*`, `StaticResources/SharedResources/*`, `definition.pbir`, `report.json` (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--definition))
- `display_name` (String) The Report display name.
- `format` (String) The Report format. Possible values: `PBIR`, `PBIR-Legacy`
- `workspace_id` (String) The Workspace ID.

### Optional

- `definition_update_enabled` (Boolean) Update definition on change of source content. Default: `true`.
- `description` (String) The Report description.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The Report ID.

<a id="nestedatt--definition"></a>

### Nested Schema for `definition`

Required:

- `source` (String) Path to the file with source of the definition part.

The source content may include placeholders for token substitution. Use the dot with the token name `{{ .TokenName }}`.

Optional:

- `tokens` (Map of String) A map of key/value pairs of tokens substitutes in the source.

Read-Only:

- `source_content_sha256` (String) SHA256 of source's content of definition part.

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
# terraform import fabric_report.example "<WorkspaceID>/<ReportID>"
terraform import fabric_report.example "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111"
