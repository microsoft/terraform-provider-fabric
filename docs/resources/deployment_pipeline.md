# fabric_deployment_pipeline (Resource)

The Deployment Pipeline resource allows you to manage a Fabric [Deployment Pipeline](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/cicd/deployment-pipelines/intro-to-deployment-pipelines).

-> This resource supports Service Principal authentication.

~> This resource is in **preview**. To access it, you must explicitly enable the `preview` mode in the provider level configuration.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "fabric_deployment_pipeline" "example" {
  display_name = "Deployment Pipeline Example"
  description  = "Deployment Pipeline Example"
  id           = data.fabric_deployment_pipeline.example.id
  stages = [
    {
      display_name = "Stage 1",
      description  = "Stage 1",
      is_public    = true,
      workspace_id = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
    },
    {
      display_name = "Stage 2",
      description  = "Stage 2",
      is_public    = false,
    }
  ]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `display_name` (String) The Deployment Pipeline display name. String length must be at most 246.
- `stages` (Attributes List) <i style="color:red;font-weight: bold">(ForceNew)</i> The collection of Deployment Pipeline stages. List must contain at least 2 elements and at most 10 elements. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--stages))

### Optional

- `description` (String) The Deployment Pipeline description. Value defaults to ``. String length must be at most 256.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The Deployment Pipeline ID.

<a id="nestedatt--stages"></a>

### Nested Schema for `stages`

Required:

- `description` (String) The description of the stage. String length must be at most 1024.
- `display_name` (String) The display name of the stage. String length must be at most 256.
- `is_public` (Boolean) Whether the stage is public.

Optional:

- `workspace_id` (String) The assigned workspace ID.

Read-Only:

- `id` (String) The ID of the stage.

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# terraform import fabric_deployment_pipeline.example "<DeploymentPipelineID>"
terraform import fabric_deployment_pipeline.example "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
```
