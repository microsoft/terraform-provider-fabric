# fabric_item_job_scheduler (Resource)

The Item Job Scheduler resource allows you to manage a Fabric [Item Job Scheduler](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/fabric/articles/).

-> This resource supports Service Principal authentication.

~> This resource is in **preview**. To access it, you must explicitly enable the `preview` mode in the provider level configuration.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
# terraform import fabric_item_job_scheduler.example "<WorkspaceID>/<ItemID>/<JobType>/<ScheduleID>"
terraform import fabric_item_job_scheduler.example "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111/MyJobType/22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222"
```
