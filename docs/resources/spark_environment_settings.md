# fabric_spark_environment_settings (Resource)

The Spark Environment Settings resource allows you to manage a Fabric [Spark Environment Settings](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-engineering/environment-manage-compute).

-> This resource supports Service Principal authentication.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "fabric_spark_environment_settings" "example" {
  workspace_id       = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
  environment_id     = "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111"
  publication_status = "Published"

  driver_cores  = 4
  driver_memory = "28g"

  executor_cores  = 4
  executor_memory = "28g"

  runtime_version = "1.2"

  dynamic_executor_allocation = {
    /*
   your settings here
   */
  }

  pool = {
    /*
   your settings here
   */
  }

  spark_properties = [
    {
      /*
   your settings here
   */
    }
  ]
}

- `workspace_id` (String) <i style="color:red;font-weight: bold">(ForceNew)</i> The Workspace ID.

### Optional

- `driver_cores` (Number) Publication status. Value must be one of : `4`, `8`, `16`, `32`, `64`.
- `driver_memory` (String) Spark driver memory. Value must be one of : `28g`, `56g`, `112g`, `224g`, `400g`.
- `dynamic_executor_allocation` (Attributes) Dynamic Executor Allocation properties. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--dynamic_executor_allocation))
- `executor_cores` (Number) Spark executor core. Value must be one of : `4`, `8`, `16`, `32`, `64`.
- `executor_memory` (String) Spark executor memory. Value must be one of : `28g`, `56g`, `112g`, `224g`, `400g`.
- `pool` (Attributes) Environment pool. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--pool))
- `runtime_version` (String) [Runtime](https://review.learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-engineering/runtime) version. Value must be one of : `1.1`, `1.2`, `1.3`.
- `spark_properties` (Attributes List) A list of Spark properties. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spark_properties))
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The Spark Environment Settings ID.

<a id="nestedatt--dynamic_executor_allocation"></a>

### Nested Schema for `dynamic_executor_allocation`

Optional:

- `enabled` (Boolean) The status of the dynamic executor allocation: `false` - Disabled, `true` - Enabled.
- `max_executors` (Number) The maximum executors. Value must be at least 1. Ensure that if an attribute is set, also these are set: "[<.min_executors]".
- `min_executors` (Number) The minimum executors. Value must be at least 1. Ensure that if an attribute is set, also these are set: "[<.max_executors]".

<a id="nestedatt--pool"></a>

### Nested Schema for `pool`

Optional:

- `name` (String) The Pool name. `Starter Pool` means using the starting pool. Ensure that if an attribute is set, also these are set: "[<.type]".
- `type` (String) The Pool type. Value must be one of : `Capacity`, `Workspace`. Ensure that if an attribute is set, also these are set: "[<.name]".

Read-Only:

- `id` (String) The Pool ID.

<a id="nestedatt--spark_properties"></a>

### Nested Schema for `spark_properties`

Optional:

- `key` (String) The Spark property key. Spark property key:
- must start with 'spark.'
- cannot contain any white spaces
- dot '.' is allowed but not at the start or end of the property key.
- `value` (String) The Spark property value.

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
