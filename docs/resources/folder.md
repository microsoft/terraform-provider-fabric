# fabric_folder (Resource)

The Folder resource allows you to manage a Fabric [Folder](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/fundamentals/workspaces-folders).

-> This resource supports Service Principal authentication.

~> This resource is in **preview**. To access it, you must explicitly enable the `preview` mode in the provider level configuration.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "fabric_folder" "example_workspace_root_folder" {
  display_name = "example"
  workspace_id = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
}

resource "fabric_folder" "example_subfolder" {
  display_name     = "example"
  workspace_id     = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
  parent_folder_id = "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111"
}

#changing the parent_folder_id will move the folder to a different parent folder
# resource "fabric_folder" "example_subfolder" {
#   display_name     = "example"
#   workspace_id     = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
#   parent_folder_id = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
# }
```

## Schema

### Required

- `display_name` (String) The Folder display name The name must meet Folder name requirements: <https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/fundamentals/workspaces-folders#folder-name-requirements>. String length must be at most 255.
- `workspace_id` (String) <i style="color:red;font-weight: bold">(ForceNew)</i> The workspace ID.

### Optional

- `parent_folder_id` (String) The parent folder ID. If not specified or null, the folder is created with the workspace as its parent folder.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The Folder ID.

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
# terraform import fabric_folder.example "<WorkspaceID>/<FolderID>"
terraform import fabric_folder.example "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111"
