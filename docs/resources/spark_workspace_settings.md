# fabric_spark_workspace_settings (Resource)

Manage a Fabric Spark Workspace Settings.

See [Spark Workspace Settings](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-engineering/workspace-admin-settings) for more information.

-> This item supports Service Principal authentication.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Example 1
resource "fabric_spark_workspace_settings" "example" {
  workspace_id = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"

  automatic_log = {
    /*
   your settings here
   */
  }

  high_concurrency = {
    /*
   your settings here
   */
  }

  environment = {
    /*
   your settings here
   */
  }

  job = {
    /*
   your settings here
   */
  }

  pool = {
    /*
   your settings here
   */
  }
}

# Example 2
resource "fabric_spark_workspace_settings" "example2" {
  workspace_id = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"

  automatic_log = {
    enabled = true
  }

  high_concurrency = {
    notebook_interactive_run_enabled = false
  }

  environment = {
    name            = "MyExampleEnvironment"
    runtime_version = "1.3"
  }

  pool = {
    default_pool = {
      name = "MyExampleCustomPool"
      type = "Workspace"
    }
    starter_pool = {
      max_executors  = 3
      max_node_count = 1
    }
    customize_compute_enabled = true
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `workspace_id` (String) The Workspace ID.

### Optional

- `automatic_log` (Attributes) Automatic Log properties. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--automatic_log))
- `environment` (Attributes) Environment properties. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--environment))
- `high_concurrency` (Attributes) High Concurrency properties. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--high_concurrency))
- `job` (Attributes) Jobs properties. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--job))
- `pool` (Attributes) Pool properties. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--pool))
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedatt--automatic_log"></a>

### Nested Schema for `automatic_log`

Optional:

- `enabled` (Boolean) The status of the automatic log. Possible values: `false` - Disabled, `true` - Enabled.

<a id="nestedatt--environment"></a>

### Nested Schema for `environment`

Optional:

- `name` (String) The name of the default environment. Empty indicated there is no workspace default environment.
- `runtime_version` (String) [Runtime](https://review.learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-engineering/runtime) version. Accepted values: `1.1`, `1.2`, `1.3`.

<a id="nestedatt--high_concurrency"></a>

### Nested Schema for `high_concurrency`

Optional:

- `notebook_interactive_run_enabled` (Boolean) The status of the high concurrency for notebook interactive run. `false` - Disabled, `true` - Enabled.
- `notebook_pipeline_run_enabled` (Boolean) The status of the high concurrency for notebook pipeline run. `false` - Disabled, `true` - Enabled.

<a id="nestedatt--job"></a>

### Nested Schema for `job`

Optional:

- `conservative_job_admission_enabled` (Boolean) Reserve maximum cores for active Spark jobs. When this setting is enabled, your Fabric capacity reserves the maximum number of cores needed for active Spark jobs, ensuring job reliability by making sure that cores are available if a job scales up. When this setting is disabled, jobs are started based on the minimum number of cores needed, letting more jobs run at the same time. `false` - Disabled, `true` - Enabled.
- `session_timeout_in_minutes` (Number) Time to terminate inactive Spark sessions. The maximum is 14 days (20160 minutes).

<a id="nestedatt--pool"></a>

### Nested Schema for `pool`

Optional:

- `customize_compute_enabled` (Boolean) Customize compute configurations for items. `false` - Disabled, `true` - Enabled.
- `default_pool` (Attributes) Default pool for workspace. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--pool--default_pool))
- `starter_pool` (Attributes) Starter pool for workspace. For more information about configuring starter pool, see [configuring starter pool](https://review.learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-engineering/configure-starter-pools). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--pool--starter_pool))

<a id="nestedatt--pool--default_pool"></a>

### Nested Schema for `pool.default_pool`

Optional:

- `name` (String) The Pool name. It should be a valid custom pool name. `Starter Pool` means use starter pool.
- `type` (String) The Pool type. Accepted values: `Capacity`, `Workspace`.

Read-Only:

- `id` (String) The Pool ID.

<a id="nestedatt--pool--starter_pool"></a>

### Nested Schema for `pool.starter_pool`

Optional:

- `max_executors` (Number) The maximum executors count.
- `max_node_count` (Number) The maximum node count.

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
