## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
# terraform import fabric_shortcut.example "<WorkspaceID>/<ItemID>/<Path>/<Name>"
terraform import fabric_shortcut.example "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111/MyShortcutPath/MyShortcutName"
