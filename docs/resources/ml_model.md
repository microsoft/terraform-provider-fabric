# fabric_ml_model (Resource)

The ML Model resource allows you to manage a Fabric [ML Model](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-science/machine-learning-model).

-> This resource does not support Service Principal. Please use a User context authentication.

~> This resource is in **preview**. To access it, you must explicitly enable the `preview` mode in the provider level configuration.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "fabric_ml_model" "example" {
  display_name = "example"
  workspace_id = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `display_name` (String) The ML Model display name.
- `workspace_id` (String) The Workspace ID.

### Optional

- `description` (String) The ML Model description.
- `folder_id` (String) The Folder ID.
- `test_attribute` (String) The ML Model description.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ML Model ID.

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
# terraform import fabric_ml_model.example "<WorkspaceID>/<MLModelID>"
terraform import fabric_ml_model.example "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111"
```
