The Tag resource allows you to manage a Fabric [Tag](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/governance/tags-overview).

-> This resource supports Service Principal authentication.

~> This resource is in **preview**. To access it, you must explicitly enable the `preview` mode in the provider level configuration.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create example
resource "fabric_tag" "example" {
  tags = [
    {
      display_name = "example"
    },
    {
      display_name = "example2"
    }
  ]
}

#Update
resource "fabric_tag" "example_update" {
  id           = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
  display_name = "example_updated"
  scope = {
    type = "Tenant"
  }
}

## Schema

### Optional

- `display_name` (String) The Tag display name. String length must be at most 40. Ensure that if an attribute is set, these are not set: "[tags]". Ensure that if an attribute is set, also these are set: "[id,scope]".
- `id` (String) The Tag ID. Ensure that if an attribute is set, these are not set: "[tags]". Ensure that if an attribute is set, also these are set: "[display_name,scope]".
- `scope` (Attributes) Represents a tag scope. Ensure that if an attribute is set, these are not set: "[tags]". Ensure that if an attribute is set, also these are set: "[id,display_name]". (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--scope))
- `tags` (Attributes List) List of tags associated with the resource. Ensure that if an attribute is set, these are not set: "[id,display_name,scope]". (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--tags))
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

<a id="nestedatt--scope"></a>

<a id="nestedatt--tags"></a>

### Nested Schema for `tags`

Required:

- `display_name` (String) The Tag display name. Ensure that if an attribute is set, also these are set: "[<.id,<.scope]".

Read-Only:

<a id="nestedatt--tags--scope"></a>

### Nested Schema for `tags.scope`

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m".
