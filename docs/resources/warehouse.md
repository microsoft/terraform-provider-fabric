# fabric_warehouse (Resource)

The Warehouse resource allows you to manage a Fabric [Warehouse](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-warehouse/data-warehousing).

-> This resource supports Service Principal authentication.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "fabric_warehouse" "example" {
  display_name = "warehouse_example"
  workspace_id = "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111"
}

# Warehouse resource with enabled schemas
resource "fabric_warehouse" "example2" {
  display_name = "warehouse_example2"
  description  = "warehouse_example2 with collation_type"
  workspace_id = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"

  configuration = {
    collation_type = "Latin1_General_100_BIN2_UTF8"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `display_name` (String) The Warehouse display name.
- `workspace_id` (String) The Workspace ID.

### Optional

- `configuration` (Attributes) The Warehouse creation configuration.

Any changes to this configuration will result in recreation of the Warehouse. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--configuration))

- `description` (String) The Warehouse description.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The Warehouse ID.
- `properties` (Attributes) The Warehouse properties. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--properties))

<a id="nestedatt--configuration"></a>

### Nested Schema for `configuration`

Required:

- `collation_type` (String) The collation type of the warehouse. Accepted values: `Latin1_General_100_BIN2_UTF8`, `Latin1_General_100_CI_AS_KS_WS_SC_UTF8`.

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

### Nested Schema for `properties`

Read-Only:

- `collation_type` (String) The collation type of the warehouse. Possible values:`Latin1_General_100_BIN2_UTF8`, `Latin1_General_100_CI_AS_KS_WS_SC_UTF8`.
- `connection_string` (String) The SQL connection string connected to the workspace containing this warehouse.
- `created_date` (String) The date and time the warehouse was created.
- `last_updated_time` (String) The date and time the warehouse was last updated.
