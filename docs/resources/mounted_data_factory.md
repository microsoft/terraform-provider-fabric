# fabric_mounted_data_factory (Resource)

Manage a Fabric Mounted Data Factory.

Use this resource to manage [Mounted Data Factory](TODO).

-> This item supports Service Principal authentication.

~> This resource is in **preview**. To access it, you must explicitly enable the `preview` mode in the provider level configuration.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Example 1 - item with definition bootstrapping only
resource "mounted_data_factory" "example_definition_bootstrap" {
  display_name              = "example"
  description               = "example with definition bootstrapping"
  workspace_id              = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
  format                    = "Default"
  definition_update_enabled = false
  definition = {
    "mountedDataFactory-content.json" = {
      source = "${local.path}/mountedDataFactory-content.json.tmpl"
      tokens = {
        "DataFactoryResourceId" = "/subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/resourceGroups/<resourceGroup>/providers/Microsoft.DataFactory/factories/<factoryName>"
      }
    }
  }
}

# Example 2 - item with definition update when source or tokens changed
resource "mounted_data_factory" "example_definition_update" {
  display_name = "example"
  description  = "example with definition update when source or tokens changed"
  workspace_id = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
  format       = "Default"
  definition = {
    "mountedDataFactory-content.json" = {
      source = "${local.path}/mountedDataFactory-content.json.tmpl"
      tokens = {
        "DataFactoryResourceId" = "/subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/resourceGroups/<resourceGroup>/providers/Microsoft.DataFactory/factories/<factoryName>"
      }
    }
  }
}

## Schema

### Required

- `definition` (Attributes Map) Definition parts. Read more about [Mounted Data Factory definition part paths](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/fabric/articles/item-management/definitions/mounted-data-factory-definition). Accepted path keys: **Default** format: `mountedDataFactory-content.json` (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--definition))
- `display_name` (String) The Mounted Data Factory display name.
- `format` (String) The Mounted Data Factory format. Possible values: `Default`
- `workspace_id` (String) The Workspace ID.

### Optional

- `definition_update_enabled` (Boolean) Update definition on change of source content. Default: `true`.
- `description` (String) The Mounted Data Factory description.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The Mounted Data Factory ID.

<a id="nestedatt--definition"></a>

### Nested Schema for `definition`

Required:

- `source` (String) Path to the file with source of the definition part.

The source content may include placeholders for token substitution. Use the dot with the token name `{{ .TokenName }}`.

Optional:

- `tokens` (Map of String) A map of key/value pairs of tokens substitutes in the source.

Read-Only:

- `source_content_sha256` (String) SHA256 of source's content of definition part.

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# terraform import mounted_data_factory.example "<WorkspaceID>/<MountedDataFactoryID>"
