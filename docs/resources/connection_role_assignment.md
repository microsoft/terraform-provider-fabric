~> This resource is in **preview**. To access it, you must explicitly enable the `preview` mode in the provider level configuration.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "fabric_connection_role_assignment" "example" {
  connection_id = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
  principal = {
    id   = "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111"
    type = "User"
  }
  role = "Owner"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `connection_id` (String) <i style="color:red;font-weight: bold">(ForceNew)</i> The Connection ID.
- `connection_role_assignment_id` (String) <i style="color:red;font-weight: bold">(ForceNew)</i> The Connection Role Assignment ID.
- `principal` (Attributes) The principal. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--principal))
- `role` (String) <i style="color:red;font-weight: bold">(ForceNew)</i> The connection role of the principal. Value must be one of : `Owner`, `User`, `UserWithReshare`.

### Optional

- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The Connection Role Assignment ID.

<a id="nestedatt--principal"></a>

### Nested Schema for `principal`

Required:

- `id` (String) <i style="color:red;font-weight: bold">(ForceNew)</i> The principal ID.
- `type` (String) <i style="color:red;font-weight: bold">(ForceNew)</i> The type of the principal. Value must be one of : `Group`, `ServicePrincipal`, `ServicePrincipalProfile`, `User`.

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
# terraform import fabric_connection_role_assignment.example "<ConnectionID>/<ConnectionRoleAssignmentID>"
terraform import fabric_connection_role_assignment.example "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111"
