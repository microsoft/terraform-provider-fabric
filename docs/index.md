# Microsoft Fabric Provider

The Microsoft Fabric Provider allows managing environments and other resources within [Microsoft Fabric](https://fabric.microsoft.com/).

!> This code is experimental and provided solely for evaluation purposes. It is **NOT** intended for production use and may contain bugs, incomplete features, or other issues. Use at your own risk, as it may undergo significant changes without notice, and no guarantees or support are provided. By using this code, you acknowledge and agree to these conditions. Consult the documentation or contact the maintainer if you have questions or concerns.

## Requirements

This provider requires **Terraform >= 1.8.x**.  For more information on provider installation and constraining provider versions, see the [Provider Requirements documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/providers/requirements).

## Installation

To install this provider, copy and paste this code into your Terraform configuration. Then, run `terraform init`.

```terraform
# We strongly recommend using the required_providers block to set the Fabric Provider source and version being used
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.8, < 2.0"
  required_providers {
    fabric = {
      source  = "microsoft/fabric"
      version = "0.1.0-beta.6"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the Microsoft Fabric Terraform Provider
provider "fabric" {
  # Configuration options
}
```

## Installation (developers only)

To use the provider you can download the binaries from [Releases](https://github.com/microsoft/terraform-provider-fabric/releases) to your local file system and configure Terraform to use your local mirror. See the [Explicit Installation Method Configuration](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/config/config-file#explicit-installation-method-configuration) for more information about using local binaries.

```hcl
# Explicit Installation Method Configuration
# docs: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/config/config-file#explicit-installation-method-configuration

provider_installation {
  filesystem_mirror {
    path    = "/usr/share/terraform/providers"
    include = ["registry.terraform.io/microsoft/fabric"]
  }
}
```

## Authentication

The provider allows authentication via service principal or user credentials. All sensitive information should be passed into Terraform using environment variables (don't put secrets in your tf files).

### Using Azure CLI (Default)

The Fabric provider can use the Azure CLI to authenticate. If you have the Azure CLI installed, you can use it to log in to your Azure account and the Fabric provider will use the credentials from the Azure CLI.

1. [Install the Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
1. Follow the [Creating an App Registration for the User context to use with Azure CLI](guides/auth_app_reg_user.md) guide.

### Using a Service Principal

You can find more information on how to do this in the following guides:

- [Authenticating using Managed Identity (MSI)](guides/auth_msi.md)
- [Authenticating using a Service Principal and OpenID Connect (OIDC)](guides/auth_spn_oidc.md)
- [Authenticating using a Service Principal and Client Certificate](guides/auth_spn_cert.md)
- [Authenticating using a Service Principal and Client Secret](guides/auth_spn_secret.md)

## Know limitations

- **Capacity**: [Microsoft Fabric trial capacity](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/get-started/fabric-trial) is not supported. Only self-provisioned [Fabric Capacity](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/enterprise/plan-capacity) on Azure is supported. You can setup your capacity in the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#browse/Microsoft.Fabric%2Fcapacities).
- **Service Principal**: Not all Fabric resources support Service Principals yet. For Provider evaluation, we recommend using the [Azure CLI for authentication with User context](guides/auth_app_reg_user.md).
