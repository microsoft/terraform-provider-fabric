# fabric_item_job_scheduler (Data Source)

The Item Job Scheduler data-source allows you to retrieve details about a Fabric [Item Job Scheduler](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/fabric/articles/).

-> This data-source supports Service Principal authentication.

~> This data-source is in **preview**. To access it, you must explicitly enable the `preview` mode in the provider level configuration.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "fabric_item_job_scheduler" "example" {
  workspace_id = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
  item_id      = "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111"
  scheduleId   = "22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222"
  jobType      = "MyJobType"
}
```

- `item_id` (String) The item ID.
- `job_type` (String) The job type.
- `workspace_id` (String) The Workspace ID.

### Optional

- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `configuration` (Attributes) The schedule configuration. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--configuration))
- `created_date_time` (String) The created time stamp of this schedule in UTC, using the YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ format.

- `occurrence` (Attributes) A date for triggering the job. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--configuration--occurrence))
- `recurrence` (Number) Specifies the monthly job repeat interval. For example, when set to 1 the job is triggered every month.
- `start_date_time` (String) The start time for this schedule. If the start time is in the past, it will trigger a job instantly. The time is in UTC, using the YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ format.
- `times` (Set of String) A list of time slots in hh:mm format, at most 100 elements are allowed.
