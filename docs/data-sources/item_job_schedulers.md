# fabric_item_job_schedulers (Data Source)

The Item Job Schedulers data-source allows you to retrieve a list of Fabric [Item Job Schedulers](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/fundamentals/job-scheduler).

-> This data-source supports Service Principal authentication.

~> This data-source is in **preview**. To access it, you must explicitly enable the `preview` mode in the provider level configuration.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "fabric_item_job_schedulers" "example" {
  workspace_id = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
  item_id      = "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111"
  job_type     = "Execute"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `item_id` (String) The Item ID.
- `job_type` (String) The type of job to filter by. If not specified, all
- `workspace_id` (String) The Workspace ID.

### Optional

- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `values` (Attributes Set) The set of Item Job Schedulers. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--values))

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

<a id="nestedatt--values"></a>

### Nested Schema for `values`

Required:

- `item_id` (String) The item ID.
- `job_type` (String) The job type. Allowed job types per item type: dataflow: {ApplyChanges, Execute}; lakehouse: {RefreshMaterializedLakeViews}.
- `workspace_id` (String) The Workspace ID.

Read-Only:

- `configuration` (Attributes) The schedule configuration. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--values--configuration))
- `created_date_time` (String) The created time stamp of this schedule in UTC, using the YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ format.
- `enabled` (Boolean) Whether this schedule is enabled. True - Enabled, False - Disabled.
- `id` (String) The Item Job Scheduler ID.
- `owner` (Attributes) The user identity that created this schedule or last modified. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--values--owner))

<a id="nestedatt--values--configuration"></a>

### Nested Schema for `values.configuration`

Read-Only:

- `end_date_time` (String) The end time for this schedule. The end time must be later than the start time. It has to be in UTC, using the YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ format.
- `interval` (Number) The time interval in minutes. A number between 1 and 5270400 (10 years).
- `occurrence` (Attributes) A date for triggering the job. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--values--configuration--occurrence))
- `recurrence` (Number) Specifies the monthly job repeat interval. For example, when set to 1 the job is triggered every month.
- `start_date_time` (String) The start time for this schedule. If the start time is in the past, it will trigger a job instantly. The time is in UTC, using the YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ format.
- `times` (Set of String) A list of time slots in hh:mm format, at most 100 elements are allowed.
- `type` (String) A string represents the type of the plan.
- `weekdays` (Set of String) A list of weekdays, at most seven elements are allowed.

<a id="nestedatt--values--configuration--occurrence"></a>

### Nested Schema for `values.configuration.occurrence`

Read-Only:

- `day_of_month` (Number) Specifies a date to trigger the job, using a value between 1 and 31. For example, 2 means the second day of the month. The date must be valid. If an invalid date is provided, such as February 31st, it will automatically skip to the month that includes the 31st day.
- `occurrence_type` (String) An enumerator that lists the day for triggering jobs.
- `week_index` (String) The week of the month.
- `weekday` (String) Week day for triggering jobs.

<a id="nestedatt--values--owner"></a>

### Nested Schema for `values.owner`

Read-Only:

- `id` (String) The principal's ID.
- `type` (String) The type of the principal.
